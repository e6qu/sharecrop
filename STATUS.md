# Status

The repository contained the pull request 1 project skeleton, pull request 2 core domain and quality-gate work, pull request 3 authentication work, pull request 4 organization provisioning work, pull request 5 contract generation work, pull request 6 schema parsing and validation work, pull request 7 task visibility and capability-token work, and pull request 8 submission, anonymous access, and sensitive-data work.

Pull request 9 was ready for review.

Active task:

- Open pull request 9 and wait for continuous integration to pass.

Implemented surface:

- Go module `github.com/e6qu/sharecrop`.
- Go binary entry point at `cmd/sharecrop`.
- `net/http` server with `/healthz` and embedded static app shell.
- Config loading for HTTP address, `DATABASE_URL`, and migrations directory.
- PostgreSQL connection boundary using `pgx`.
- Plain SQL migration runner with `sharecrop migrate up`.
- Initial migration file.
- Docker Compose Postgres service on local port `15432`.
- Elm app shell.
- Tailwind build through Deno-managed tooling.
- Deno smoke test harness.
- Go HTTP unit tests.
- HTTP end-to-end smoke tests behind the `http_e2e` build tag.
- Playwright user interface smoke test.
- Manual screenshot helper.
- `make` commands for build, test, serve, migration, frontend, and user interface end-to-end.
- Core domain foundations for errors, IDs, lifecycle states, and visibility scopes.
- continuous integration workflow for pull requests targeting `main`, split into parallel jobs: static checks (formatting, contracts, policy, type checks, copy-paste, dead-code, lint, vet), unit tests, frontend and binary build, Postgres integration tests, HTTP end-to-end tests, and Playwright user interface end-to-end tests.
- Explicit configuration loading without fallback values.
- Authentication domain and boundary code under `internal/auth`.
- Registered user creation and login endpoints.
- Guest subject creation endpoint.
- Refresh endpoint using opaque rotating refresh-token cookies.
- JSON Web Token access tokens signed by local standard-library code.
- PostgreSQL authentication tables and repository code.
- Organization and team identifiers.
- Organization names, team names, membership statuses, roles, and permissions.
- Organization service methods for creation, listing, member provisioning, member deactivation, team creation, and team listing.
- PostgreSQL organization, membership, role, team, and team-member tables.
- HTTP organization endpoints protected by verified bearer access tokens.
- Go-owned contract definitions under `internal/contracts`.
- Deterministic Elm contract generation for auth, errors, identifiers, organizations, and teams.
- Generated Elm modules under `web/elm/src/Sharecrop/Generated/`.
- The handwritten Elm app directly consumes a generated auth contract type.
- Makefile contract generation and deterministic contract checks.
- Local Sharecrop schema domain types under `internal/schema`.
- Schema JSON parsing for object, array, string, integer, decimal string, enum, literal, union, and freeform schemas.
- Response payload parsing into Sharecrop-owned value types.
- Schema validation with typed validation errors and field paths.
- Sensitive-field indexing and redaction for typed response values.
- Task series, tasks, task visibility scopes, and task capability token tables.
- Task owner, task state, task series placement, visibility, payload, and capability-token domain types.
- Task service methods for creation, opening, cancellation, listing, and capability-token creation.
- Task PostgreSQL repository code.
- HTTP task endpoints for creation, listing, opening, cancellation, and capability-token creation.
- Organization-owned tasks default to organization-scoped visibility when the request uses default visibility.
- Public organization tasks require the organization public-publisher permission.
- Task response schemas are parsed by the local Sharecrop schema parser during task creation.
- Generated Elm task contract enums and list-item read models.
- Submission and submission receipt-token identifiers.
- Submission, receipt-token, validation-error, and sensitive-field-index tables.
- Submission domain types for authenticated submitters, anonymous wallet submitters, lifecycle states, validation outcomes, and receipt tokens.
- Submission service methods for authenticated submission, anonymous public submission, receipt lookup, and requester submission listing.
- Submission PostgreSQL repository code.
- HTTP submission endpoints for authenticated submission, anonymous public submission, receipt lookup, and task submission listing.
- Anonymous submissions require public tasks and store payout wallet addresses without user linkage.
- Submission responses are validated against the task response schema and invalid responses are recorded with validation errors.
- Receipt lookup redacts sensitive fields from response JSON.
- Generated Elm submission contracts.
- Credit account and ledger identifiers.
- Credit account, append-only ledger entry, and task escrow tables.
- A single-accepted partial unique index on submissions.
- Credit domain types for positive credit amounts, signed ledger amounts, derived balances, ledger entry kinds, escrow states, and idempotency keys.
- A ledger service for task funding, submission acceptance with payout, task refund, balance lookup, and ledger listing.
- Each new registered user receives a credit account and a `signup_grant` of 100 credits in the user-creation transaction.
- Task funding escrows credits from the funder and requires sufficient balance.
- Submission acceptance is transactional, enforces a single accepted submission per task, and pays the accepted authenticated worker from the escrow.
- Task refund cancels a funded task and returns escrowed credits to the funder.
- Fund, accept, and refund use idempotency keys.
- HTTP endpoints for credit balance, ledger listing, task funding, submission acceptance, and task refund.
- An integer reference type in the contract generator and a single-field record decoder fix.
- Generated Elm ledger contracts.
- An interactive Elm app with register/login, a credit balance and ledger view, and a task funding form backed by the API.
- A separate Postgres-backed integration test tier under the `integration` build tag.
- continuous integration split into parallel static, unit, build, integration, HTTP end-to-end, and Playwright jobs.
